Freicoin 0.9.5rc1 BETA
======================

Copyright (c) 2009-2015 Bitcoin Developers


Setup
---------------------
[Freicoin Core](http://freico.in/) is the original Freicoin client and it builds the backbone of the network. However, it downloads and stores the entire history of Freicoin transactions (which is currently several hundred MBs); depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more. Thankfully you only have to do this once.

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run Freicoin on your native platform. 

### Unix

You need the Qt4 run-time libraries to run Freicoin-Qt. On Debian or Ubuntu:

	sudo apt-get install libqtgui4

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- bin/32/freicoin-qt (GUI, 32-bit) or bin/32/freicoind (headless, 32-bit)
- bin/64/freicoin-qt (GUI, 64-bit) or bin/64/freicoind (headless, 64-bit)

### Windows

Unpack the files into a directory, and then run freicoin-qt.exe.

### OSX

Drag Freicoin-Qt to your applications folder, and then run Freicoin-Qt.
